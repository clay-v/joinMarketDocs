</code></pre></div><p>Balances displayed by <a href="#the-wallet-toolpy-script"><code>wallet-tool.py</code></a> <strong>include unconfirmed amounts</strong> by default. This (i.e. treating unconfirmed coins as available) is <strong>not currently supported</strong> when running <a href="#entities">bot entities</a>, based on the problematic nature of spending unconfirmed coins, but can be done by editing configuration. For details on the fine-grained control over what conis are considered available, see the advice in the default version of <code>joinmarket.cfg</code> that is held in the file <code>configure.py</code>.</p> <h2 id="use-of-external-and-internal-branches"><a href="#use-of-external-and-internal-branches" class="header-anchor">#</a> Use of external and internal branches.</h2> <p>Payments into the wallet should be made into new addresses on the <code>external</code> branch for any mixdepth. For the above wallet, <code>muaApeqh9L4aQvR6Fn52oDiqz8jKKu9Rfz</code> (from mixdepth 2) or <code>mrgNjQWjrBDB821o1Q3qG6EmKJmEqgjtqY</code> (from mixdepth 4) would be suitable candidates. The index of the address on the branch is shown as the final 3 digit integer in the identifier. As usual with deterministic wallets, a configurable gap-limit variable is used to determine how far forwards to search after unused/new addresses are located.</p> <p>In joinmarket <a href="#transactions">transactions</a>, a single destination output goes to the address designated by the transaction initiator (which need not be an address in a joinmarket wallet; it could be any valid Bitcoin address, including P2SH). The remaining outputs go to internal addresses as follows:</p> <ul><li>If the transaction initiator has any change left (&quot;sweep&quot; transactions send a precise amount, without leaving change), it is sent to a new address in the internal branch of the same mixdepth as the initiator's inputs.</li> <li>Each liquidity provider sends a single change output to a new address in the same mixdepth as its inputs.</li> <li>Each liquidity provider sends a single output (with size identical to that of the destination output) to a new address in the next mixdepth, wrapping back to the first (that is, the mixdepth in BIP32 branch zero) upon reaching <code>max_mix_depth</code>.</li></ul> <p>The logic of this is fairly straightforward, and central to how Joinmarket works, so make sure to understand it: <strong>the coinjoin outputs of a transaction must not be reused with any of the inputs to that same transaction, or any other output that can be connected with them, as this would allow fairly trivial linkage</strong>. Merging such outputs is avoided by picking the inputs for a transaction only from a single mixdepth (although both internal and external branches can be used).</p> <h2 id="wallet-object"><a href="#wallet-object" class="header-anchor">#</a> <code>Wallet</code> object</h2> <p>The <code>Wallet</code> class is found in the module <code>joinmarket.wallet</code>.

JoinMarket transactions are of the simplest type described there: there is one coordinating party (the <em>taker</em>) who combines his own inputs with inputs from many <em>makers</em> and produces a template of a transaction with N+1 <strong>equal</strong> outputs (of a size decided by the taker), one for each maker plus himself, and as many change outputs as are required. In the current Joinmarket implementation, there is one change for each participant, except (a) if the taker has deliberately chosen to spend all of his inputs to the coinjoin output, see <a href="#sweepjmtx">sweeps</a>, or (b) in rare cases, by accident, one maker has exactly the right amount in his inputs for the coinjoin output.</p> <p>After constructing the template transaction, the taker broadcasts the template to the makers, who transfer valid signatures back to the taker. The taker then adds his own signatures and broadcasts the bitcoin transaction.</p> <p>This design allows for change outputs for maximum practicability. Insisting on <em>only</em> equal sized outputs (only &quot;coinjoin outputs&quot; in this terminology) would considerably improve privacy benefits but makes coordinating to achieve the goal nearly impossible.</p> <p>Critical to making this work effectively is avoiding <strong>address reuse</strong>. If coinjoin outputs later get reused with change outputs that link back to either the inputs, or the change outputs, in the same transaction, then the coinjoin output can be linked to them, destroying the purpose of the transaction. For this reason, Joinmarket <a href="#wallets">wallets</a> use a BIP32 hierarchical deterministic structure and enforce that the coinjoin outputs are on a different branch than the inputs and change outputs.</p> <p>The next section shows the basic types of transaction that can occur in JoinMarket and illustrate these points in a more concrete fashion.</p> <h2 id="joinmarket-transaction-types"><a href="#joinmarket-transaction-types" class="header-anchor">#</a> Joinmarket transaction types</h2> <p>We can define 4 distinct joinmarket transaction types. We use the notation &quot;JMTx&quot; for all of these, and separate short hand versions for each one.</p> <ol><li><p>SourceJMTx
This is usually an ordinary bitcoin transaction paying into an unused address on an external branch for any one of the mixdepths of the wallet. As such it has no special joinmarket structure; it will usually have a change output, which will go back to the wallet funding this one. It <em>could</em>, however, be a payment from another joinmarket wallet, although most users will not be using more than one joinmarket wallet. This doesn't affect the analysis, in any case.</p></li> <li><p>(Canonical) CJMTx
The most fundamental type of joinmarket transaction involves neither a 'source' nor a 'sink', but only spends from this joinmarket wallet to itself, in conjunction with joining counterparties. The coinjoin output goes to a new address on the internal branch of the <em>next</em> mixdepth, as was described in the previous section.</p></li></ol> <p><img src="/images/CJMTx.png" alt="alt text"></p> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: the above diagram ignores transaction fees and coinjoin fees for simplicity, which slightly change the size of the change outputs; this obviously cannot be ignored in real analysis.</p> <ol start="3"><li><p>SpendJMTx
This is a 'sink' transaction. This, generated either by <code>sendpayment.py</code> or <code>tumbler.py</code> scripts usually, will be the same as the CJMTx above, except with the difference that the coinjoin output for the initiator (taker) goes to an address from another wallet, e.g. a payment or a transfer to an external wallet.</p></li> <li><p>SweepJMTx
This can be either a 'sink' or not, depending on the destination of the coinjoin output. A sweep is characterised by 2 things: (a) the initiator will not create a change output, and (b) the initiator will consume <strong>all</strong> of the utxos in the given mixdepth (both internal and external branches) as inputs, leaving no coins left in that mixdepth.</p></li></ol> <p><img src="/images/SweepJMTx.png" alt="alt text"></p> <hr> <h1 id="entities"><a href="#entities" class="header-anchor">#</a> Entities</h1> <p>All entities are subclassed from <code>CoinJoinerPeer</code>, which has the instance member <code>self.msgchan</code>.

The startup process is, at a high level, :</p> <ul><li>Parse command line and load configuration from <code>joinmarket.cfg</code></li> <li>load wallet</li> <li>initialize message channel and register callbacks</li> <li>start message channel listening loop</li></ul> <p>Once a request is received from a taker, the maker creates a new <code>CoinJoinOrder</code> object instance, and this performs the handshake, initializes encryption on the messaging channel, and exchanges the data for the transaction. Then, a listening thread is set up to listen for <strong>announcement of the new bitcoin transaction on the network</strong> (see <code>unconfirm_callback</code>), and for <strong>inclusion of the bitcoin transaction in a block</strong> (see <code>confirm_callback</code>).</p> <p><strong>NB: Handling concurrent requests:</strong> If two takers attempt to fill the same order at once, the maker will <strong>not</strong> lock the utxos immediately a request is initiated, but will mark those utxos as consumed as soon as the <code>unconfirm_callback</code> is triggered (i.e. the negotiated transaction is seen on the bitcoin network). A little reflection will show that this is the only design that makes sense. After a taker has negotiated a transaction, he is under no obligation to actually broadcast it to the bitcoin network, nor is he certain to have received the right signatures from all other makers (they may have crashed, or dropped off the network, or sent garbage signatures, etc.). So this maker has no particular reason to expect that the transaction will ever be broadcast. Even worse, a taker may deliberately DOS attack makers by requesting transactions and then not broadcasting. Hence, it's necessary that makers do not mark utxos as &quot;used&quot; until and unless they see the negotiated transaction broadcast. This <em>does</em> create a slightly unfortunate fact that two takers who successfully negotiate different transactions using this maker's utxos are in a race to broadcast them, but this is unavoidable.</p> <p><strong>Keeping track of state for individual takers</strong>: A maker will only perform one transaction for one particular taker at a time. The instance variable <code>self.active_orders</code> is a dict for which the keys are the names of taker counterparties, and the values are <code>CoinJoinOrder</code> objects, each of which contains a <code>libnacl.public.Box</code> object used for encrypted messaging with that counterparty. If a taker tries to start a new transaction while a previous one is incomplete, the new <code>CoinJoinOrder</code> overwrites the old one (and a new encryption Box is set up).</p> <h3 id="the-coinjoinorder-object"><a href="#the-coinjoinorder-object" class="header-anchor">#</a> The CoinJoinOrder object</h3> <p>The <code>CoinJoinOrder</code> object is perhaps poorly named; it manages the process of negotiating a single transaction with a taker for this maker, once a order fill request has been received.

So the startup process is basically identical to that listed above for the maker.</p> <p>Whether the taker initiates one transaction or many, once it has broadcast its final transaction, it simply quits. For a series of transaction, it uses the same design as the maker to listen for blockchain events: it adds <code>unconfirm_callback</code> and <code>confirm_callback</code> to its <code>BlockchainInterface</code> instance. Since there is no competition for its utxos, there is no need for specific actions in response to transaction arrival on the bitcoin network, so <code>unconfirm_callback</code> need not do anything (except perhaps print debugging information), but the <code>confirm_callback</code> can be used to trigger the next transaction in the taker's chosen sequence of transactions, and also requires update of the wallet state to refer to the new utxos.</p> <h3 id="the-coinjointx-object"><a href="#the-coinjointx-object" class="header-anchor">#</a> The <code>CoinJoinTX</code> object</h3> <p>This plays a similar role to <code>CoinJoinOrder</code> for <code>Maker</code>. A taker only processes one <code>CoinJoinTx</code> object at a time, and its process is initiated in the constructor. When a taker is ready to initiate a transaction with a decided-on set of makers, it calls <code>Taker.start_cj()</code> with arguments specifying its chosen orders (from makers), coinjoin amount, output addresses, utxos and transaction fee and then initiates a handshake, sets up encryption, transfers transaction data, receives signatures and then signs itself and pushes the transaction to the bitcoin network.</p> <h3 id="handling-unresponsive-makers"><a href="#handling-unresponsive-makers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Handling unresponsive makers</h3> <p>It is not uncommon for the makers to fail to respond at any stage of transaction negotiation. To handle this, the <code>CoinJoinTX</code> object contains a <code>TimeoutThread</code> which keeps track of how long we've been waiting for all of the makers specified for the transaction. If the timeout (specified in the configuration variable <code>maker_timeout_sec</code>) is exceeded, the function <code>CoinJoinTX.recover_from_nonrespondants()</code> is called, allowing the taker to restart the process from the beginning.</p> <p>Note that it is also possible to manually specify makers with which the taker does not want to join, by amending the <code>ignored_makers</code> list.

For other transactions, the amount must be specified in satoshis.</p> <p>The <code>destaddr</code> is the address which will receive the coinjoin amount (the amount specified in <code>amount</code>). Note that specifying a non-p2pkh address (i.e. a p2sh address, usually for multisig - addresses starting with '3' on the main bitcoin network) is highly inadvisable, as it allows immediate linkage of that coinjoin output to the input and change address.</p> <p>The default mixdepth from which the spend will occur is mixdepth 0. Otherwise, the user must specify the mixdepth with the <code>-m</code> flag.</p> <p>The user also specifies the number of counterparties with which to join. Choosing -N 1 is not recommended since this allows the counterparty to know the taker's destination address. The default is 2, but numbers from 3-5 are probably most suitable. Larger figures suffer from larger transaction fees, as well as potential unreliability problems.</p> <p>Once the configuration has been set, the sendpayment script starts a <code>PaymentThread</code> thread object, which does the following:</p> <p>First, it extracts the list of available orders from its internal <code>self.db</code> object. Then, it estimates the bitcoin transaction fee (see the separate <a href="#bitcoin-transaction-fees">section</a>).</p> <p>Next, the most important part of the code is the method of choosing which orders, read from the orderbook, are to be used for the construction of the join transaction. See the functions <code>sendpayment_choose_orders</code> in <code>sendpayment.py</code> and <code>choose_sweep_orders</code> in <code>support.py</code>. Within these functions, the ranking of orders is performed by one of three functions found in <code>support.py</code>:</p> <ul><li>pick_order</li> <li>cheapest_order_choose</li> <li>weighted_order_choose</li></ul> <p>with the last of the three being the default. The logic behind the default is deferred to a separate <a href="#weighted-orders-choose">section</a>. Also note that <code>pick_order</code> cannot be used in conjunction with sweeping.</p> <p>Once the set of orders has been chosen and the fees set (and the coinjoin amount, for sweeps), the process continues as described above for Takers, i.e. <code>Taker.start_cj</code> is called with the defined parameters.

This is because until the list of counterparty (maker) orders is chosen, the total coinjoin fee is not known (since each maker specifies their own coinjoin fee, and contribution to the total bitcoin transaction fee). The code handles this problem in the <code>choose_sweep_orders</code> function in <code>support.py</code>. It does this in an iterative process: first, the set of available orders is constructed. Then, each order is selected one by one based on the choose_orders algorithm the user preferred (which must be one of <code>weighted_order_choose</code> or <code>cheapest_order_choose</code>). Multiple orders from the same counterparty are rejected. Then, the coinjoin amount is calculated so as to leave zero change. Finally, each order in the chosen set is examined to see whether the newly calculated coinjoin amount is within its <code>minsize</code> and <code>maxsize</code> parameters. If not, that order is removed from the list, and the iteration continues until <em>all</em> chosen orders match with the calculated coinjoin size.</p> <p>The extra logic for bitcoin transaction fee handling for sweeps is covered in the bitcoin transaction fee <a href="#bitcoin-transaction-fees">section</a>.</p> <h4 id="the-tumbler-script"><a href="#the-tumbler-script" class="header-anchor">#</a> The tumbler script</h4> <p>This is designed to allow a <code>Taker</code> to heavily (if not perfectly) delink the coins in the wallet by means of a long sequence of coinjoins.

The broad functionality, required for any messaging layer is (ordered by priority):</p> <ul><li>Both broadcast and private messaging</li> <li>Low latency (sub-second at least)</li> <li>Availability (including DOS resistance)</li> <li>Anonymity or facility thereof using common technologies (specifically, Tor)</li> <li>Scalability</li> <li>Censorship Resistance</li></ul> <p>Note that the list does <em>not</em> include encryption, because E2E encryption technology (including authentication and message integrity) can be used as a layer over the messaging channel. Thus while use of TLS for connection to the messaging layer may be desirable, it isn't necessary.</p> <p>Scalability is important due to the use of broadcast messages. It would be desirable to minimise this requirement; for example, using federated servers which publish orders out-of-band.</p> <p>Decentralization: not using centralized hubs/servers avoids trust issues and avoids potential censorship (can also help with availability, in some scenarios). Purely decentralized P2P messaging is a little difficult to achieve, especially for users who are not technically sophisticated (see: NAT punching).</p> <p>Censorship resistance must be strong against the peers themselves. For example in a pure p2p network the makers have an incentive to not forward offers from competing makers.</p> <p>The message channel's functionality is abstracted in the module <code>message_channel.py</code>. The message_channel class contains methods for <em>sending</em> messages and for <em>registering callbacks to receive messages</em>.</p> <h2 id="encrypted-messaging"><a href="#encrypted-messaging" class="header-anchor">#</a> Encrypted messaging</h2> <p>For the sake of privacy, it is required to end-to-end encrypt some part of the messages transferred between parties taking part in a coinjoin transaction. Note that this is not required for monetary security; that is handled by Bitcoin itself; technically it is also not <em>required</em> for coinjoin; a coinjoin in which the messages between participants are in plaintext over the wire would allow any passive observer to deduce the coin linkages, but not a future observer of the blockchain. Clearly, this distinction is somewhat academic and it would be highly undesirable to do coinjoins in this way entirely in plaintext over the wire.</p> <p>The technology used for this purpose is Daniel J Bernstein's <a href="https://nacl.cr.yp.to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NaCl<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>, which uses Curve25519 elliptic curve cryptography and the Salsa20 stream cipher, with Poly1305 as the MAC.

Of course (1) is a rather nebulous &quot;event&quot; since it's not global and not necessarily final, but for practical purposes it's treated as an event. As was discussed in the <a href="#maker">Maker</a> and <a href="#taker">Taker</a> sections, these events trigger callbacks <code>unconfirmfun</code> and <code>confirmfun</code>, which vary per entity. Triggering this requires &quot;listening&quot; to the blockchain.</p> <p>Thus, after a <code>Maker</code> or <code>Taker</code> has completed transaction negotiation with their counterparty, they access the global bc_interface (by calling <code>configure.jm_single().bc_interface</code>) and start a <code>NotifyThread</code>. This is done via a call to <code>add_tx_notify</code> (TODO why isn't this an abstract method? don't all blockchaininterface instances need it?).</p> <p>The call to <code>add_tx_notify</code> appends an entry to a list named <code>txnotify_fun</code>, which is a list of tuples of the format <code>(tx_output_set, unconfirmfun, confirmfun)</code>.</p> <p><strong>For BitcoinCoreInterface</strong>: On the first call to <code>add_tx_notify</code>, the <code>NotifyThread</code> thread is started. This thread starts an http server daemon, listening on the (host,port) specified in the configuration under section &quot;BLOCKCHAIN&quot; and settings &quot;notify_host&quot;, &quot;notify_port&quot;.</p> <p>The http daemon is an instance of <code>BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer</code> and is instantiated with a class derived from <code>BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler</code> named <code>NotifyRequestHeader</code>. This class receives <code>HEAD</code> requests, specifically:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>/walletnotify?
/alertnotify?
</code></pre></div><p>This corresponds to configuration in BitcoinCore that allows it to make HTTP requests whenever a wallet 'event' occurs (the arrival of (unconfirm) or confirmation of a transaction which is connected to the wallet). Note that the addresses in the <strong>Joinmarket</strong> <a href="#wallets">wallet</a> are added as watch-only to Bitcoin Core, meaning that Core does not know their private keys but keeps track of them in a separate account. The account is named as</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>joinmarket-XXXXXX
</code></pre></div><p>(XXXXXX = first 6 characters of the hex encoding of double-sha256 of the first address in the external branch of the first mixdepth of the Joinmarket wallet). Thus Bitcoin Core is set up to fire <code>walletnotify</code> when an event happens for the <code>Maker</code> or <code>Taker</code>'s wallet.</p> <p><code>alertnotify</code> is triggered by alerts in BitcoinCore, which happens very rarely. The information in the alert is passed on to Joinmarket and it is displayed on the terminal as well as in the logs.</p> <p>On subsequent calls, extra callbacks (<code>unconfirmfun</code> and <code>confirmfun</code>) are added to the <code>bc_interface.txnotify_fun</code> list, to be called for each blockchain event. Over long periods of operation therefore, a long list of such notify functions could accrue; but since this is just a list of function pointers, it isn't important.</p> <p>On reception of a <code>/walletnotify?txid</code> request, the <code>NotifyRequestHeader.do_HEAD</code> method is called, which checks the content of the transaction specified by <code>txid</code> by calling <code>getrawtransaction</code>, and then searches the set of elements of <code>BitcoinCoreInterface.notify_fun</code> to see if any of them contain the outputs of the transaction in their first element <code>tx_output_set</code> as described above. If so, it is those functions <code>unconfirmfun</code> and <code>confirmfun</code> which are the other two elements of the tuple in that list entry, which are called (which is called depends on whether the transaction data got from <code>getrawtransaction</code> shows the number of confirmations as zero or not).</p> <p><strong>For BlockrInterface</strong> :</p> <p>In this case, each call to <code>add_tx_notify</code> spawns a separate <code>NotifyThread</code> object. Hardcoded (currently) timeouts are used to decide when to stop listening for transaction arrival and confirmation:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>unconfirm_timeout = 10 * 60  # seconds
unconfirm_poll_period = 5
confirm_timeout = 2 * 60 * 60
confirm_poll_period = 5 * 60
</code></pre></div><p>This is unfortunately a necessary design; we must poll with API calls to the remote server to update the state. No doubt, there are more sophisticated and efficient designs that could be looked into.</p> <p>The thread is initiated with the transaction data and the specific <code>unconfirmfun</code> and <code>confirmfun</code> function pointers to trigger once the events occur on the blockchain.</p> <hr> <h1 id="bitcoin-transaction-fees"><a href="#bitcoin-transaction-fees" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bitcoin Transaction Fees</h1> <p>The earlier versions of Joinmarket used a fixed transaction fee, with a 10000 satoshi default and the ability to customise it by the Taker, using the <code>-f</code> option to <code>sendpayment.py</code> and <code>tumbler.py</code>. This is clearly not ideal, since the effectiveness of a particular transaction fee in allowing quick confirmation is a function of the size of the transaction in bytes. It was regularly observed that transactions are created with large size (say, 2-4 kB) and which were not being confirmed quickly.</p> <h2 id="fee-estimation-calculation"><a href="#fee-estimation-calculation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fee Estimation Calculation</h2> <p>First, the size of a transaction in bytes must be estimated. This is currently found in <code>bitcoin.main.estimate_tx_size</code>, which shows the formula in comments:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>'''Estimate transaction size.
Assuming p2pkh:
out: 8+1+3+2+20=34, in: 1+32+4+1+1+~73+1+1+33=147,
ver:4,seq:4, +2 (len in,out)
total ~= 34*len_out + 147*len_in + 10 (sig sizes vary slightly)
'''
</code></pre></div><p>To expand: the 34 * (number of outputs in the bitcoin transaction) + 147* (number of inputs) + 10 is estimated as the size of the transaction in bytes. <strong>Note</strong> that this is not correct for p2sh transactions, but a separate more sophisticated calculation including the possibility of mixed p2pkh and p2sh utxos is not yet implemented.</p> <p>The output of this calculation is passed to <code>wallet.estimate_tx_fee()</code>, which takes the number of bytes and multiplies it by the estimated fee per kB (see the list of abstract methods in <a href="#blockchain-interface">BlockchainInterface</a>). The estimated fee per kB is dependent on the configuration variable set in the config section POLICY and the variable <code>tx_fees</code>, which (confusingly?) is the number of confirmations to target. Thus a relatively impatient Taker may set <code>tx_fees</code> to 1, to target confirmation in the next block, and a relatively patient taker may set it to 3 or more.</p> <hr> <h1 id="orders-and-the-trading-pit"><a href="#orders-and-the-trading-pit" class="header-anchor">#</a> Orders and the trading pit</h1> <p>The joinmarket 'pit' is where communication takes place in order to coordinate joins.
